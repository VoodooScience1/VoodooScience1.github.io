                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Philip Cook. I am currently studying for a BSc (Hons) in Project Management at the University of Portsmouth, Law and Business School. Additionally, I will achieve attaining the APM PMQ qualification and an Apprenticeship EPA (End Point Assessment) will be undertaken.<br/><br/>

                        During the course, I hope to further my technical abilities in Project Management; gain understanding and practical experience on the methodologies; as well as further enhancing one of the most important, but overlooked qualities of a Project Manager, soft skills.<br/><br/>

                        Currently I work for an Aerospace Engineering company, Hamble Aerostructures Limited, an Aernnova Company (formerly GE Aviation). My current role is a Commercial Engineer, categorised under sales, but with strong engineering requirements. Responsible for new product bids, repairs/spare/scrap pricing, data analysis and other activities as required. The role requires good team ethics and interpersonal skills due to its inherent cross functional nature.<br/><br/>

                        Below is my career history up-till now.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It's important to plan ahead and set yourself goals, not just professionally, but personally too. Goal setting ensures that you have an aim, and this makes you work hard for it. Without an aim, you have no reason to improve, no reason to save, no reason to get fitter. Why bother, what are you doing it for? You have no aim.<br/><br/>

                        Sometimes these deadlines can be soft, sometimes they will be hard; but the important thing is that you are working towards bettering yourself to some capacity, be it promotion, buying a house or marathon. Everyone has room for improvement, no one is perfect; you just have to be honest and critical with yourself and decide where these imporvements can be made. Or, perhaps you just want something to boast about down the pub, and that's fine too! 
                        <br/><br/>

                        This is not an exhaustive list of my goals, as I am a notorious planner and goal setter (which drives my misses loopy), but this is a selection of some of the more related goals that I have, and a few that are not.

                        <p>
                            Profiling is an objective and impartial (to a degree) way to assesss what personailty traits you have, and what kind of colleague you would make. A questionnaire is filled out, where you vote on a sliding scale of where you feel you sit in regard to the statement. Number crunching by a computer then tells you what your "personality" is.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
                        <p>
                            It is diffuclt to give an objective representation of yourself, as you will inherently have some bias. You'll want to be the best you. So this forces you to measure yourself, but there are no wrong answers. This can bring light to some areas you may need to work on based on your persoinality trait that is presented.

                        <p>
                            With regard to this analysis, this means that I am somewhat unlikely to innovate (something I do disagree with, as I have made a nubmer of new things at my curernt work). I shows that I have a propensity towards these styles however, therefore it would be beneficial to have other team members that are within the alternative learning styles. This would ensure that as much information and knowledge as possible could be utilised.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Alternatives - VARK</h2>
                        <p>
                            VARK, or Visual-Auditory-Reading-Kinesthetic, is another moteholodgy that suggests styles of learning from a different perspective. The VARK model suggests the following:
                            <li>
                                Visual, Learns through seeing
                            </li> 
                            <li>
                                Auditory, learns through hearing and speaking
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Reading, learns through reading/research 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Kinethetic, practical, touching and doing
                            </li>
                            <br/>
                            I would suggest that I err towards the Kinesthetic side, as I learn much quicker by doing and trying; however I am able to use all methods. This ties in with the Activator profile, as it has similarities.

You need people to plan, people to investigate, people to come up with ideas, etc. From my test, as a Monitor / Evaluator, I lie in the "thinking" realm; typically I would be best utilised in the planning stages of a project.

                            I believe I am probably more of an activator than suggested, but perhaps my ability to do a wide breadth makes me more versatile. I believe I am a tactile learner, and I'd class myself as Kinesthetic.<br/><br/>

                            With regard to the Belbin Teams model, I believe there is something to be said about the result. I would agree with the strengths, however I am believe I am very ambitious and also highly supportive of my colleagues. This is perhaps something I need to discuss further with my fellow colleageus to determine if that is in fact correct.

                            SWOT was designed and developed by Albert Humphrey during his post at the Stanford Research Institute between 1960-1970. It is a method that can be used for analysing a variety of thing such as projects, processes and also oneself. Here, I use it for the latter.

                            One issue with this is it's entirely self reliant on the person creating it to give honest and accurate accounts.

Those with (Iopp) is where I believe I am the opposite to what my traits suggest.

                    <div style="text-align: left;">
                        <p>
                            The GROW model was designed and developed in the 1980s by business coaches Graham Alexander, Alan Fine and Sir John Whitmore. It is a simple methodology that gets the individual to critically look at oneself and understand what they want, where they are, what they can do to ge there, and how they'll do it. These are important steps in order to realise self-improvement.<br/><br/>

                            At present I believe there are 6 key goals that would be very beneficial to my success in my career. I have identified the following goals, and below each detailed what the reality is, what my options are, and how I can proceed to achieve the goal:
                        </p>

                        <div class="tab">
                            <input type="checkbox" id="chck9">
                            <label class="tab-label" for="chck9">Degree</label>
                            <div class="tab-content">
                                This is an important goal as it ensures that I am both competent in my role as well as respected. Having a degree ensures that other individuals can trust that I have the skill set to make appropriate descisions.
                                <h3>Reality</h3>
                                I currently have a HNC in Aeronautical Engineering, which is un-related.
                                <h3>Options</h3>
                                My option is to complete the BSc in Project Management that I have been given the opportunity to do.
                                <h3>Way-Forward</h3>
                                As above, make the most of the BSc, learn as much as I can, and complete the degree with an excellent grade. I should also ensure that I employ as much as I can back at my workplace to reinforce the learning.
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="tab">
                            <input type="checkbox" id="chck10">
                            <label class="tab-label" for="chck10">Excellent Soft-Skills</label>
                            <div class="tab-content">
                                Excellent soft skills is a much overlook, but integral part of being a succesful PM. Being able to get people on-side, convince others your descisions are right, and forge strong ralationships of trust are very important if you want people to follow your instructions. 
                                <h3>Reality</h3>
                                I have good soft skills currently, but as these are not directly PM based they could do with some additional work.
                                <h3>Options</h3>
                                Trying and failing, and imporivng with reflection is a good way to go. So is reading, and practising.
                                <h3>Way-Forward</h3>
                                If I continue to learn from colleagues, peers, books and lecurers, this is a good starting point. Going to some events such as the APM events to network will help these skills. It would be beneficial to get some management on a project too to utilise them more directly.

                                <h3>Reality</h3>
                                Currently my skills are limited, only though what I have learnt from reading around and activities at work.
                                <h3>Options</h3>
                                Styfying for my degree is the start, this will give me somew of the skills. It is important to also look to ym colleagues and to gain experiences to reinforce these skills.
                                <h3>Way-Forward</h3>
                                Going forward I must ensure that I study hard to gain the skills and go back to work and implement these skills; this will reinforce the learning and ensure that I am effective.

                                Success is difficult to define, but for me success looks like promotions, stability, long-term prospects and respect from others.
                                <h3>Reality</h3>
                                Right now I am at the start of my career, and therefore have little in the way of success. I do deem moving to the commercial role I am currently doing a success however. 
                                <h3>Options</h3>
                                My options are to work work hard and show my ability; and ultimately gain respect and promotions.
                                <h3>Way-Forward</h3>
                                To ensure this happens I must continue what I am doing, working hard and showing ability. I need to go above and beyond my job role to show that I am diverse and innovative, and a great asset to the company; with nothing too much of an ask. But I need to be careful I do not over stretch myself.

                                As a manager, it is inevitable that you will have to present. Wheter ir be internally metrics to show performace, or to your customers and stakeholders, where issues arise or where innovations are to be made. This is an important skill to have.
                                <h3>Reality</h3>
                                Very minimal presentation experience, having only done one in college in the last 4 years.
                                <h3>Options</h3>
                                Gain the opportunity to generate and present. Also, I can self-teach ways to present, as well as practice.
                                <h3>Way-Forward</h3>
                                Going foreward I will be seeking support from my line manager to present some of our high-level meetings that we have. This will give me visibility to the executives while also developing my skills and attaining feedback to further improve.

                                <h3>Reality</h3>
                                I have a distinct lack of patience for waffle and what I see as slow progress.
                                <h3>Options</h3>
                                Work with the individuals mroe closeley to understand what the process is that they go through and better appreciate the process.

                                With a new bid on the table currently, I am going to be seeking to work closely with the individuals that are doingn the design and engineering, so I can better appreciate the process.
