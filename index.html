                    <p>
                        Hi, my name is Philip Cook. I am currently studying for a BSc (Hons) in Project Management at the University of Portsmouth, Law and Business School. Additionally, I will achieve attaining the APM PMQ qualification and an Apprenticeship EPA (End Point Assessment) will be undertaken.<br/><br/>

                        During the course, I hope to further my technical abilities in Project Management; gain understanding and practical experience on the methodologies; as well as further enhancing one of the most important, but overlooked qualities of a Project Manager, soft skills.<br/><br/>

                        Currently I work for an Aerospace Engineering company, Hamble Aerostructures Limited, an Aernnova Company (formerly GE Aviation). My current role is a Commercial Engineer, categorised under sales, but with strong engineering requirements. Responsible for new product bids, repairs/spare/scrap pricing, data analysis and other activities as required. The role requires good team ethics and interpersonal skills due to its inherent cross functional nature.<br/><br/>

                        Below is my career history up-till now.
                    </p>

                    <h1>About HAL Ltd</h1>
                    <p>
                        Hamble Aerostructures Limited (HAL), an Aernnova Company; has recently changed hands (January 2020), formerly we were GE Aviation. The site has changed hands many times over the 80 years of existence, amounting to 12 different owners altogether.
                        <br/><br/>

                        At HAL we design, engineer, manufacture, treat, machine and assemble aircraft composite and metallic components and structures. With a revenue of circa ~$250m; a head count of around 700; and customers such as Airbus, BAE and Bombardier; we are a small structures company, but with big impact.<br/><br/>

                        Some of our biggest project include the design and manufacture of the Airbus A350 Trailing Edge Details (TED) and Trailing Edge Secondary Structure (TESS); the build of over 500 Dash 8 Nacelles for the Bombardier Dash 8 Aircraft; 50 years of BAE Hawk Canopy production; and numerous other Military and Civil programmes.<br/><br/>

                        We have been Taken over by Aernnova, and now form 25% of its entire business, both in headcount and revenue. Now, more than ever it is important that the inevitable upcoming changes are managed effectively, and the project managers are performing consistently and productively across the business.

                    <h1>Short, Medium and Long-Term Goals</h1>
                    <p>
                        It's important to plan ahead and set yourself goals, not just professionally, but personally too. Goal setting ensures that you have an aim, and this makes you work hard for it. Without an aim, you have no reason to improve, no reason to save, no reason to get fitter. Why bother, what are you doing it for? You have no aim.<br/><br/>

                        Sometimes these deadlines can be soft, sometimes they will be hard; but the important thing is that you are working towards bettering yourself to some capacity, be it promotion, buying a house or marathon. Everyone has room for improvement, no one is perfect; you just have to be honest and critical with yourself and decide where these imporvements can be made. Or, perhaps you just want something to boast about down the pub, and that's fine too! 
                        <br/><br/>

                        This is not an exhaustive list of my goals, as I am a notorious planner and goal setter (which drives my misses loopy), but this is a selection of some of the more related goals that I have, and a few that are not.

                        <h2>Why do profiling?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Profiling is an objective and impartial (to a degree) way to assesss what personailty traits you have, and what kind of colleague you would make. A questionnaire is filled out, where you vote on a sliding scale of where you feel you sit in regard to the statement. Number crunching by a computer then tells you what your "personality" is.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Why does it matter?</h2>
                        <p>
                            It is diffuclt to give an objective representation of yourself, as you will inherently have some bias. You'll want to be the best you. So this forces you to measure yourself, but there are no wrong answers. This can bring light to some areas you may need to work on based on your persoinality trait that is presented.

However, it could also mean I am unclear, which may cause tension; however this is not soemthing I believe is the case.

                            With regard to this analysis, this means that I am somewhat unlikely to innovate (something I do disagree with, as I have made a nubmer of new things at my curernt work). I shows that I have a propensity towards these styles however, therefore it would be beneficial to have other team members that are within the alternative learning styles. This would ensure that as much information and knowledge as possible could be utilised.

                        <h2>Alternatives - VARK</h2>

                            VARK, or Visual-Auditory-Reading-Kinesthetic, is another moteholodgy that suggests styles of learning from a different perspective. The VARK model suggests the following:
                            <li>
                                Visual, Learns through seeing
                            </li> 
                            <li>
                                Auditory, learns through hearing and speaking
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Reading, learns through reading/research 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Kinethetic, practical, touching and doing
                            </li>
                            I would suggest that I err towards the Kinesthetic side, as I learn much quicker by doing and trying; however I am able to use all methods. This ties in with the Activator profile, as it has similarities.

                            I believe I am probably more of an activator than suggested, but perhaps my ability to do a wide breadth makes me more versatile. I believe I am a tactile learner, and I'd class myself as Kinesthetic.<br/><br/>

                            With regard to the Belbin Teams model, I believe there is something to be said about the result. I would agree with the strengths, however I am believe I am very ambitious and also highly supportive of my colleagues. This is perhaps something I need to discuss further with my fellow colleageus to determine if that is in fact correct.
